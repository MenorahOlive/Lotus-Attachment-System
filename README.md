# Project Title
Optimizing University Attachments using a Web-Based System for Streamlined Document Collection and Planning

##Project Description
The process of planning and documentation of student attachments in universities can be a time-consuming and challenging task. The evaluation procedure involves site visits and manual submissions of document reports. Planning site visits poses logistical difficulties due to ineffective communication. In addition, the submission of hardcopy reports leads to long-term environmental degradation. This project aims to alleviate these problems by developing an attachment system to automate the process. The proposed system is designed to address gaps in existing solutions by offering novel features, such as a platform for the online documentation of weekly logs and reports. Additionally, it will enable synchronized planning and communication between the faculty supervisor and the student using a coordinated calendar and chatting module, among other features. The system will benefit universities significantly, including improved document management, increased efficiency, and seamless organization of the attachment process. The proposed solution aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). In general, the project will decrease the administrative workload for staff and result in a more positive experience for students.

##Features
i.	Authentication module- this module is a security plug-in that will be used to verify the user profiles that exist in the system against entries in the database. 
ii. Logbook module- this module provides features for documentation of weekly logs that entail the activities carried out by the student during the attachment period.
iii.	Attachment initialization module- this module is necessary for attachment application and allocation. 
iv.	Attachment report collection module – this module supports the submission of pdf attachments by the student user.  
v.	Chat module -this module is responsible for providing a platform for communication via the student user and the supervisor user. 
vi.	Grading module- The grading module oversees displaying the final grade of the student user. This will be achieved through automatic calculations by the system based on assigned marks and assessment weights.
vii.	Admin module- this module will be used for ana overall view of the entire system by a super administrator. 
viii.	Calendar – this module will integrate the Google Calendar API. This will improve the efficiency of planning for events such as site visits. 
ix.	Maps – this module will integrate the Google Maps API. The aim of this module 
will be to improve the site visit experience for the supervisor user as they locate the student users for on-site visits and assessments.
